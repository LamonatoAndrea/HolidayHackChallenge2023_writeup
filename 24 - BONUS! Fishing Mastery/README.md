One approach to automating web tasks entails the browser's developer console. Browsers' console allow us to manipulate objects, inspect code, and even interact with [websockets](https://javascript.info/websocket).
#### Fishing Machine

There are a variety of strategies for automating repetative website tasks. Tools such as [AutoKey](https://github.com/autokey/autokey) and [AutoIt](https://www.autoitscript.com/site/) allow you to programmatically examine elements on the screen and emulate user inputs.

### Solution
I let my script run for quite a while but I wasnâ€™t able to obtain all the fish, so I looked at the images I downloaded from https://2023.holidayhackchallenge.com/sea/fishdensityref.html. I understood that white gradient in the image would indicate where a fish could be found. I started overlapping the density with the [minimap](https://2023.holidayhackchallenge.com/sea/assets/minimap.png) and thought about automating the whole process of moving & catching for each fish. When doing that I noticed the Piscis Cyberneticus Skodo having a really narrow catching area that can be seen in white in the image below:
