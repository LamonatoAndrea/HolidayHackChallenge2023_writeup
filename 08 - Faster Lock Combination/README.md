## Faster Lock Combination
Difficulty: :christmas_tree:   
Over on Steampunk Island, Bow Ninecandle is having trouble opening a padlock. Do some research and see if you can help open it!

### Solution
Even though not listed as a hint, Bow Ninecandle itself provides the link to a very good youtube tutorial named ‚Äú[\[198\] Close Up On How To Decode A Dial Combination Lock In 8 Attempts Or Less](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27rE5ZvWLU0)‚Äù, which I basically followed before going ballistic üôÇ

#### The first digit
By applying some tension so as to have the ‚ÄúTension Status‚Äù indicator looking brown, I determined $13 as the sticky number, with $4$ and $7$ being the guess numbers. To obtain the first number then: $n1 = sticky + 5 = 13 + 5 = 18$.

#### The third digit
A little more math gives us the remainder to watch out for $r = n1 / 4 = 18 / 4 = 4 R 2$. Based on the guess number, we can write down a table such as the following:
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| ------------ | --- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | --- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| GUESS NUMBER | $4$ | $4 + 10 = 14$ | $4 + 20 = 24$ | $4 + 30 = 34$ | $7$ | $7 + 10 = 17$ | $7 + 20 = 27$ | $7 + 30 = 37$ |
| REMAINDER | $4 / 4 = 1 R 0$ | $14 / 4 = 3 R 2$ | $24 / 4 = 6 R 0$ | $34 / 4 = 8 R 2$ | $7 / 4 = 1 R 3$ | $17 / 4 = 4 R 1$ | $27 / 4 = 6 R 3$ | $37 / 4 = 9 R 1$ |

Elegible third digits are the ones for which remainder matches $r$, the one obtaining by divinding $n1$ by $4$:
* $14$
* $34$ 

By applying the tension and further verifying the two eligible numbers, $14$ looked more promising being the loosest, but I also kept $34$ just in case.

#### The second digit
To obtain the second digit is used the below table:
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --------------------------- | ----------- | ------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | 
| Row 1 - $Remainder + 2 = 4$ | $4 + 0 = 4$ | $4 + 8 = 12$ | $4 + 16 = 20$ | $4 + 24 = 34$ | $4 + 32 = 36$ |
| Row 2 - $Remainder + 6 = 8$ | $8 + 0 = 8$ | $8 + 8 = 16$ | $8 + 16 = 24$ | $8 + 24 = 32$ | $8 + 32 = 40$ | 
Eliminating those being 2 digits apart from the third digits, below the list of attempts:
* $n1 = 18, n2 = {4, 8, 20, 24, 32, 34, 36, 40}, n3 = 14$
* $n1 = 18, n2 = {4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 40}, n3 = 34$
