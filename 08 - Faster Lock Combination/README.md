## Faster Lock Combination
Difficulty: :christmas_tree:   
Over on Steampunk Island, Bow Ninecandle is having trouble opening a padlock. Do some research and see if you can help open it!

### Solution
Even though not listed as a hint, Bow Ninecandle itself provides the link to a very good youtube tutorial named “[\[198\] Close Up On How To Decode A Dial Combination Lock In 8 Attempts Or Less](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27rE5ZvWLU0)”, which I basically followed before going ballistic 🙂

#### The first digit
By applying some tension so as to have the “Tension Status” indicator looking brown, I determined $13 as the sticky number, with $4$ and $7$ being the guess numbers. To obtain the first number then: $$n1 = sticky + 5 = 13 + 5 = 18.$$
